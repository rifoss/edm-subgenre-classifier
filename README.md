# My EDM Classifier Project

## Project Overview
This repository holds the code for a 12-week machine learning project designed to classify EDM subgenres based on audio features extracted using Librosa.

## Current Phase
This initial phase focuses on foundational Git and scikit-learn training

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following key directories
* 'notebooks/': Contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model training experiments ('.ipynb' files)
* 'data/': Stores raw audio files and processed feature CSVs.
* 'src/': Holds modular Python scripts and functions for feature extraction and serving the model.
